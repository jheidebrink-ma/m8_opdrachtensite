## 1. Bootstrap
{: .text-blue-200}
Bootstrap might be the most popular and well-known CSS framework in the world. And while our list includes many alternatives to Bootstrap, you can’t go wrong with this CSS framework designed by Twitter, as it provides a comprehensive set of tools and assets for designing web applications.

Bootstrap is also well-documented, making it easy to find resources. It’s one of the most popular CSS frameworks and has a large and active online community of users. We also found an 11-hour Bootstrap course for beginners.
